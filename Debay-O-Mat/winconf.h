 * The debayering project is intended to provide a platform independent 
 * debayering software for processing any RAW image data for film, movie, cinema, 
 * photography to provide a natural touch and 35mm film look
 *
 * For further information about the debayering project, please see the
 * project website: http://www.debayering.com
 *
 * The debayering project features several different debayering algorithms
 * like bilinear, shoodak and gaussian. Some debayering algorithms offer a 
 * variable mix of random distortion. Images can be softened by the built-in 
 * variable gaussian blur. It comes with an artificial film grain, 
 * offers color transformation by LUT cube and variable rescaling.
 * All effects can be mixed at a variable ratio
